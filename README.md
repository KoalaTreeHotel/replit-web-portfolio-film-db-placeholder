# Placeholder Website for Embedding a Replit Page

Embedding replit pages stopped working so this placeholder website is no longer needed.
Instead, the portfolio website directly points to the replit website where the code
can be run.

The code on the replit site is uploaded from <git clone git@bitbucket.org:weebucket/python-jit-w11-d03-assignment-sqlite-pandas-retro-view-to-cmd.git>
